      Whether to consolidate ticker changes to current symbols.
      If true: Maps old tickers to current ones (FB → META)
      If false: Returns all ticker symbols as-is (both FB and META)
    notes: |
      When enabled, companies that changed tickers will appear only once
      under their current ticker. Useful for:
      - Counting unique companies (not unique ticker symbols)
      - Avoiding duplicate positions in portfolios
      - Data fetching (Tiingo migrates data to new tickers)

output:
  type: list
  item_type: str
  description: |
    List of ticker symbols that were members at ANY point during the period.
    Eliminates survivorship bias by including:
    - Current members
    - Removed members (delisted, acquired, merged)
    - Stocks that joined and left during the period
  example: ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "FOX", "TWX", ...]
